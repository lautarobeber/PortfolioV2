          In 2021, looking for new directions in my life, I decided to leave my
          studies as a Civil Engineer, and began my career as a Senior
          Programming Technician at the Teclab Institute, and fell headlong into
          the rabbit hole of coding and web development. If we move forward to
          today, I am one subject away from receiving my degree, and at the same
          time, seeking to gain experience, I began to create my projects and
          participate in communities where they voluntarily allow you to be part
          of projects in real life, with a work team and agile methodologies.
